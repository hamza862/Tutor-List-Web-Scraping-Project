# Tutor-List-Web-Scraping-Project
This is Web Scraping task to scrap the data from a website to store the required information in a CSV format.
I used Python's most powerful library Beautiful Soup to scrap the data from the website.
After scraping the data, I created a Pandas DataFrame and stored the data in that DataFrame.
At the end, I created a CSV file from Pandas DataFrame to display the outputs.
